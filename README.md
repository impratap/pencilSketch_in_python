# pencilSketch_in_python

This is a small project in which I have converted a normal image into Pencil Sketch

First of all imported necessary Library

import cv2 (open cv)

Then loaded the normal image.

And at last first process the image into blur using the Gaussian Function in Open CV and make it into Pencil Sketch...
